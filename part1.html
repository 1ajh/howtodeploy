   <h1>1: What is deployment?</h1> 
   <p>Website deployment is the process of taking a website you’ve built and making it available on the internet for others to access. It’s how your website goes from being just on your computer to being live online for everyone to visit.</p>

<p>For example, after designing and coding your website, deployment means putting it on a server or hosting platform so it has a public URL. This URL is what people type in their browsers to see your website.</p>
<p>Think of it like baking a cake. First, you gather your ingredients and follow the recipe (coding the website). Then, you bake the cake and check that it’s ready to serve (testing the website). Finally, you place it on a table for everyone to enjoy (deploying the website).</p>
<p>In simple terms, website deployment usually involves uploading your website’s files to a server or a hosting service. This makes sure the website is properly stored, runs smoothly, and can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.</p>
