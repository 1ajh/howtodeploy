    <h1>2: Static vs Dynamic</h1>
    <p>Websites can be categorized as either static or dynamic, and their deployments are different because of how they work and the tools they require.</p>

<p>Static websites are simple and consist of fixed content. They are made up of files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the same content is displayed to every visitor. Deploying static websites is straightforward because you only need to upload the files to a web server or a static hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These services can quickly serve static files to users without requiring a backend or database.</p>
<p>Dynamic websites, on the other hand, generate content on the fly based on user interactions or data from a database. They use server-side code, such as PHP, Python, or Node.js, and often rely on a backend and a database to function. Deploying dynamic websites is more complex because you need to configure the server to handle the backend processes and ensure the database is properly connected. Hosting platforms like Heroku, AWS, or dedicated servers are typically used for dynamic websites.</p>
<p>The key difference to look out for when deploying static and dynamic websites is the infrastructure. Static sites need a simple server that can deliver files, while dynamic sites require a server capable of running backend code and managing databases. Additionally, dynamic sites may need extra steps, such as securing sensitive data, setting up APIs, or managing scalability to handle more users.</p>
<p>When deploying a static site, you should focus on ensuring the files are uploaded correctly, URLs are working, and caching is optimized for faster loading. For dynamic sites, you need to verify that the backend is properly configured, the database is connected, and security measures like HTTPS and data protection are in place to keep everything running smoothly.</p>
