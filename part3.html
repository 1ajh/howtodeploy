    <h1>3: Deployment options</h1>
    <p>When it comes to deploying a website, there are different options depending on whether your site is static or dynamic. Choosing the right deployment option ensures your website runs efficiently and reaches your audience effectively.</p>

<p>Static websites are straightforward to deploy because they consist of fixed files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Popular platforms for deploying static websites include <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/pages/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Pages</a>. These platforms offer free hosting options, fast delivery through CDNs, and simple setup processes.</p>

<p>Dynamic websites, which rely on server-side code and databases, require more advanced deployment options. Hosting providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a>, and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> allow you to configure servers to run backend code and manage databases. These platforms provide flexibility and scalability for more complex websites.</p>

<p>For static sites, deployment is usually a matter of uploading your files to a hosting platform, while dynamic sites involve setting up a server environment, installing necessary software, and ensuring the database connection is functional. It's important to understand your site's requirements and choose a platform that matches its needs.</p>

<p>If you're unsure which option to choose, start with a static site deployment for simple websites. For dynamic websites, consider hosting providers that offer tutorials and support to help with setup, ensuring a smooth deployment process.</p>
