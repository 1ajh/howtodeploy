    <h1>4B: Deploy dynamic</h1>
<p>1. **Choose a hosting provider**: First, you’ll need to buy a hosting plan from a provider that supports dynamic websites, such as <a href="https://www.hostgator.com/" target="_blank">HostGator</a>, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/" target="_blank">Bluehost</a>, or <a href="https://www.siteground.com/" target="_blank">SiteGround</a>.</p>
<p>2. **Get FTP details**: Once you've signed up and set up your hosting account, your provider will give you FTP details like the FTP server address, username, and password. You’ll use these to connect to the server.</p>
<p>3. **Install necessary software**: If your dynamic site uses server-side code (like PHP, Node.js, or Python), make sure your server supports it. Most hosting services have options for common technologies, but check if you need to install or configure any software like a database (e.g., MySQL) or server-side language runtimes.</p>
<p>4. **Prepare your website files**: Organize your website’s files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side code, and database files (if you’re using a database). Make sure everything is ready to be uploaded.</p>
<p>5. **Use an FTP client**: Download an FTP client like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>. Open the client and enter the FTP details you got from your hosting provider to connect to the server.</p>
<p>6. **Upload files**: Once connected, navigate to the server’s “public_html” or equivalent folder, and upload your website files from your computer to the server. For dynamic sites, ensure that your server-side scripts are correctly placed and that your database is set up properly.</p>
<p>7. **Test your site**: After uploading your files, test your website by visiting the URL provided by your hosting provider. Make sure all dynamic features are working, like form submissions or database interactions.</p>
<p>8. **Troubleshooting**: If something isn’t working, check for common issues like missing files, incorrect permissions, or issues with your database connection.</p>
<p>Once everything is set up correctly, your dynamic website will be live on the server and accessible to the public!</p>
